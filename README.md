# pimp_my_rig

pimp_my_rig is a project consisting of simple, lightweight scripts to get you up and running if you are a noob ArchLinux user. The scripts provide you with a menu of options to a certain degree which facilitates the installation for those of you who are either very lazy or illiterate ( happens to the best of us ). 

> If you are not lazy nor illiterate, please check out
